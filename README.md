# FBScraper
FB groups scraper in Python 2.7
This is one of my first projects using the Python language.
It was created to deepen my knowlage in python and help filter the information needed for me.
Written for the groups that does not support using Graph API.
Program module calls Orchestrator class which is the main class that orchestrate the program.
Argument: yaml configuration file where user set configuration for the program to read from
Using Beautifulsoup as scarping package. Using Selenium to FB Login.
The posts are saved after being filtered at Mongo DB. 
It is loaded from DB and presented to user so he can watch the post content, and update DB.
If mail address is recognized, he can send mail with the previously written module - CV Sender.
I hope it will assist you well.

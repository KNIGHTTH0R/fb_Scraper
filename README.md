# FBScraper
FB groups scraper in Python 2.7 <br />
This is one of my first projects using the Python language.<br />
It was created to deepen my knowlage in python and help filter the information needed for me.<br />
Written for the groups that does not support using Graph API.<br />
Program module calls Orchestrator class which is the main class that orchestrate the program.<br />
Argument: yaml configuration file where user set configuration for the program to read from<br />
Using Beautifulsoup as scarping package. Using Selenium to FB Login.<br />
The posts are saved after being filtered at Mongo DB. <br />
It is loaded from DB and presented to user so he can watch the post content, and update DB.<br />
